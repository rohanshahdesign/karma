## Task Dependencies Summary

### Critical Path (Must be completed in order):

1. **Project Setup** (1.1-1.4) â†’ **Environment** (2.1-2.3) â†’ **Database** (3.1-3.4) â†’ **Auth** (4.1-4.4) â†’ **Core API** (5.1-5.4) â†’ **Workspace** (6.1-6.3) â†’ **Currency** (7.1-7.4) â†’ **UI Foundation** (8.1-8.4)

### Parallel Development Paths:

- **Advanced Features** (9.1-9.4) can start after Core API (5.4)
- **Admin Features** (10.1-10.4) can start after UI Foundation (8.4)
- **Integrations** (11.1-11.3) can start after Core API (5.4) and require manual setup (2.3)
- **Production** (12.1-12.4) requires manual setup (2.3) and can start after basic functionality

### User vs Developer Tasks:

- **User Tasks**: External service setup (Supabase, Google OAuth, Vercel, Slack, Teams)
- **Developer Tasks**: All coding, configuration, and implementation work

---

## Current Status Overview

- **Total Tasks**: 40+ subtasks across 12 major categories
- **Completed**: Project Setup (1.1-1.4), Environment (2.1-2.3), Database (3.1-3.4), Auth (4.1-4.4), Core API (5.1-5.4), API Utilities (6.0)
- **Ready to Start**: Workspace Management (6.1-6.3) - Depends on API Utilities (6.0)
- **Blocked**: UI and advanced features waiting for workspace foundation
- **Critical Path**: Focus on completing workspace management before moving to currency system

## Next Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Implement Workspace Management (Tasks 6.1-6.3)
2. **Next**: Build Dual Balance System (Tasks 7.1-7.3)
3. **Then**: Create UI Component Library (Tasks 8.1-8.4)
4. **Parallel**: Begin advanced features development while UI is being built
