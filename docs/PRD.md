1. Vision

Build a lightweight, fun yet impactful recognition platform where employees can share recognition currency with peers, earn rewards, and foster a transparent culture of appreciation.

2. Goals

Encourage peer-to-peer recognition.

Provide both company-managed and default rewards.

Ensure transparency through public transaction history.

Make it flexible for organizations to customize according to their needs.

3.2 Recognition Currency System

3.2.1 Dual Balance Economy

To encourage continuous recognition and prevent hoarding, the system operates on a dual balance model.

Giving Balance (Allowance):

Each employee receives a monthly "Giving Balance".

This balance is exclusively for giving currency to peers. It cannot be used for reward redemptions.

The Giving Balance resets on the 1st of each month and does not roll over. This creates a "use it or lose it" incentive to recognize others consistently.

Admins and Super Admins receive a higher monthly Giving Balance to empower them to amplify recognition.

Redeemable Balance (Earned):

This is the balance an employee accumulates by receiving currency from their colleagues.

The Redeemable Balance is used to redeem items from the Rewards shop.

It does not expire and accumulates over time.

3.2.2 Sending Currency

Button to send currency to any user in the org.

Public feed of “who gave whom and why” (optional comment).

3.2.3 Public Feed

Organization-wide feed showing all transactions.

Example: “Rohan gave 10 Karma to Shubham for helping with design review.”

3.2.4 User Profile & History

Each user has a profile containing:

Total currency earned (Redeemable Balance).

Breakdown of transactions (from whom, for what).

Badges earned.

Leaderboard rank.

3.2.5 Leaderboards

Show top currency earners by week, month, or all-time.

Option to filter by team/department.

3.2.6 Gamification: Badges & Achievements

To add a layer of fun and multi-faceted recognition, the platform includes a badge system.

Badge Criteria: Badges are awarded for milestones like:
- Giving: "Generous Giver" (sending 1000 currency), "First Mover" (recognizing a new hire).
- Receiving: "Team Player" (receiving currency from 10+ colleagues).
- Streaks: "Recognition Champion" (giving currency every week for a month).

Profile Display: A "Badges" section on the user profile showcases all earned badges.

3.3 Rewards System

(The detailed rewards list remains the same as before)

3.4 Core Integrations

To ensure seamless adoption, the platform will launch with core chat integrations.

Slack & Microsoft Teams:

Enable employees to give currency directly from their chat client (e.g., `/karma @user <amount> for <reason>`).

Push notifications for currency received directly to the user's chat client.

3.5 Culture & Mitigation Strategies

To ensure the system has a positive impact, the platform will guide admins on best practices.

Managerial Amplification: Admins are given a larger "Giving Balance" to lead by example and amplify recognition for their teams.

Mitigating Unhealthy Competition: To counter the "popularity contest" effect, the platform will feature diversified leaderboards:
- "Top Givers" Leaderboard.
- "Most Badges Earned".
- Team-Based Leaderboards.

4. Future Enhancements

QR-based Scanning (B2C idea) – employees can scan QR codes at events or partner stores to earn currency.

Deeper Integrations:
- Jira/GitHub – earn currency for closing tasks, commits, etc.
- Payroll/HR integration – link the system to HR/payroll systems.
- Job portal – showcase high-currency employees externally (gamified recruiting).

5. Defaults (Platform Settings)

Initial Currency Balance: Suggested default = 100.

(Reward prices remain the same)

6. Success Metrics

% of employees actively sending currency weekly.

Number of transactions per month.
